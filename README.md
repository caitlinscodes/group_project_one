# Group Project #1 | BuzzWordz

## Objectives

In this project, we worked together to create a book and cocktail pairing generator that matches the user's book genre selection to a list of book options within that genre and generates an accompanying list of cocktails that would pair well.

We utilized HTML and CSS to create the wireframes and the majority of the styling for our two pages. Javascript was used to run the two APIs in the background and push the results to the results page. We also used local storage to populate the user's previous results in a sidebar on the results page and save the user's login information.
